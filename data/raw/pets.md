## General Pet Travel Information & Requirements

If you're planning to travel with your pet, you must complete necessary paperwork and meet requirements before your trip. Start this process early.

### USDA Assistance
Are you taking your pet from the United States to another country? Contact a USDA-accredited veterinarian immediately. They will help determine the destination country's pet entry requirements and guide you through the process.

### Travel & Entry Documentation
- **Varying Requirements:** Pet vaccination, documentation, and entry requirements differ for each destination. Check the specific requirements for **every destination** on your itinerary well in advance.
- **International Travel:** Restrictions, requirements, and documentation for dogs (including service dogs) and cats depend on origin, destination, booking date, and travel date.
- **U.S. Entry:** Requirements for pets entering the U.S. vary by country of origin. Failure to meet these may lead to issues upon arrival, including refused entry.
- **Rabies Certificate (Outside U.S.):** If traveling outside the U.S. with a dog older than 12 weeks, you must present a valid rabies vaccination certificate including: identifying characteristics (breed, sex, age, color, markings), vaccination date (at least 30 days before arrival), expiration date (if none, vaccination must be within 12 months of entry), and a licensed veterinarian's signature.
