## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Is there a fee for same-day switches?
Same-day switches (as well as same-day standby) are subject to a $75 fee (but no difference in fare), with the following exceptions: 
- If you booked a Blue Extra fare, you can make same-day switches for free. (That’s no fee, no difference in fare.) 
- Same-day switches or same-day standby are not allowed on Blue Basic Fares, even for Mosaic members. 
- Please note that same-day switches (and same-day standby) are not allowed on Blue Basic fares booked on or after Mar 18, 2024. 

To qualify as a same-day switch:
- The booking must be changed on the calendar day you were scheduled to depart, beginning at midnight in the time zone of the departure airport. Or, if you’re a Mosaic member, same-day switches can be made up to 24 hours before your scheduled departure.
- You must be switching to a different departure time (earlier or later) on the same day as the original departure.
- The origin and destination cities must remain the same, but you can change airports within the same city (so, for instance LGA to JFK).

Of course, if the difference in fare is less than $75, you have the option of cancelling your flight and making a new booking to avoid paying the same-day switch fee.

### My travel plans may change. Which is the most flexible fare?
Blue Extra offers the most flexibility. In addition to no change or cancellation fees, you get the extra perk of same-day switches and same-day standby without paying a difference in fare. It also includes priority security in select airports, plus early boarding. 

Blue, Blue Plus and Mint fares do not have change or cancellation fees but a fare difference may apply, and changes are subject to fare rules applicable on date of change. 

Blue Basic fares booked on or after Mar 18, 2024 cannot be changed but can be cancelled for a fee of $100 per person (North America, Central America, Caribbean) or $200 per person (other routes), then rebooked at the new fare. 

Blue Basic fares booked before Mar 18, 2024 may be changed or cancelled for a fee of $100 per person (North America, Central America, Caribbean) or $200 per person (other routes). Subject to fare difference. 

You can make same-day switches and or fly same-day standby if the difference in fare is more than $75. Please note that Blue Basic fares booked on or after Mar 18, 2024 are not eligible for same-day switches or same-day standby. Blue Basic fares are not eligible for same-day switches or same-day standby. This rule applies to Mosaic customers. 

For cancellations, funds will be in the form of a JetBlue travel credit, valid for 12 months from original ticketing date. 

You also have the option to purchase one of our refundable fares, to have funds credited back to the original form of payment.

### Can families traveling together be seated together with Blue Basic?

The entire booking must be cancelled to qualify (not applicable for JetBlue Vacations reservations).

### Nonrefundable fare policy

### Partially used reservation (Refundable)
If you wish to cancel any remaining travel after a portion of your refundable trip has been taken, your refund amount will equal the one-way fare for the portion of the trip cancelled. This also applies if a portion of your travel is not operated as scheduled by JetBlue.

### No show or missed flight (Refundable)
Refundable fares must be changed or cancelled prior to the scheduled departure time in order to receive a refund to the original form of payment. If a flight is missed, the money associated with the reservation will be in the form of a JetBlue travel credit, valid for 12 months from original ticketing date, and may be applied toward future travel.

- The link in the password creation email expires after 48 hours. If you haven’t received or can’t locate these emails, you can request your login ID and/or reset your password with our online login look-up form. 
- You’ll need to use your login ID and password every time you want to view or use your Travel Bank account.

### What can travel credits be used for?
Travel credits can be used to book a reservation for anyone you’d like. The name on the account doesn't need to match the name of the traveler. 

JetBlue travel credits can be applied to:
- Airfare and taxes on any flight booked through jetblue.com.
- The air portion of a JetBlue Vacations package.

Travel credits cannot be applied to:

- You now have full access to the Travel Bank. 

Access Travel Bank with a linked TrueBlue account:

- If you would like to review your Travel Bank statement, select Travel Bank Credit from the dropdown menu. You should be automatically logged into your Travel Bank account to view your Travel Bank statement.
- Any travel credits issued to you should be visible when you log in to your TrueBlue account. If you don’t see them, your TrueBlue account and your Travel Bank account might not be linked. 
- Expired travel credits will not display in your TrueBlue dropdown.

### Locate and link travel credits
To assist you more quickly, please have answers to the following common questions.
- Was the travel credit issued in your name? 
- Did you receive multiple emails about your travel credits, but the credits don’t appear in your account? 
- Does your email address match your TrueBlue email address? To verify if they match, try logging into TrueBlue.  

For assistance, please contact us. 
- For travel credits issued in your name, we’ll need to locate the Travel Bank account(s) and possibly merge them with your TrueBlue account. 
- If a Travel Bank account was created under another customer’s name, it cannot be merged to your TrueBlue account. However, you can still access the Travel Bank account and use the travel credits if you have the account’s unique login details.  
- The unique login details can be found in the welcome email we sent when the Travel Bank account was created.  
- If you are unable to find the welcome email, please complete the Login Look-Up Form and we will resend you the login details. 

### How to use travel credits
**How to use travel credits while booking:**
- If you have a TrueBlue account linked to your Travel Bank account, log in before you begin to book your trip. You also have the option to sign in during the booking process. 
- If your Travel Bank is not linked to your TrueBlue account, or you are not logged in, you will have the option to log into your Travel Bank account on the payment screen while booking.  

**Need to use travel credits in Manage Trips?**
- If you don’t have a Travel Bank account, select create a new account in Manage Trips. 
- If you have an existing Travel Bank account that is not attached to a TrueBlue account, log into your Travel Bank account on the Manage Trips payment page. 
- If you have an existing Travel Bank account that is attached to your TrueBlue account, log into your TrueBlue account and your Travel Bank Credits will auto-populate.

### How long does it take for travel credits to show up in my account?
Travel credits generally show in your account immediately upon cancellation of your ticket. If you do not see that credit, please log out of your account and log back in. 
Keep in mind that travel credits are subject to their original expiration dates. If you booked using a travel credit and canceled the ticket, credit that has already expired will not be redeposited into your account.

If you experienced a flight delay or cancellation, it may take up to 7 days for credit to be issued in accordance with JetBlue's Bill of Rights.

For third-party bookings, be sure to add your email address and TrueBlue number to your reservation. If credit is not received after 7 days, please contact us for assistance. 
Not every flight is eligible for compensation, so please review Our Customer Service Plan for more information on flight eligibility.

### Using multiple travel bank accounts

**Can I transfer my travel credits to someone else’s account, or merge accounts?**
- At this time, we’re unable to merge accounts when the names, dates of birth and email addresses on the accounts do not match.  
- Remember, you can still use your credits to book a flight for someone else, but cannot put your credits into their account.  
- If you have duplicate Travel Bank accounts or need to merge a Travel Bank account with a TrueBlue account belonging to the same person, please contact us for assistance. 

**Can I use multiple Travel Bank accounts for one transaction?**
- No, you’ll need to create separate bookings to access each Travel Bank account and the corresponding credits.
- If you’re booking for more than one person and want to be on the same reservation, you may contact us to have Travel Bank funds applied. 
- We can only apply credits from one Travel Bank account per person. 

**Can I use my travel credit to purchase a flight for someone else?**
- Yes. Just book a flight as usual and be sure to enter the other traveler’s details instead of your own.  
- If you have a TrueBlue account, be sure to log in there first so you can see your available Travel Bank funds and then proceed with the booking process. 
- If you do not have a TrueBlue account, log in to your own Travel Bank account and apply the amount of travel credits you’d like to use towards the ticket when you reach the payment screen.  
- If the traveler you’re booking for has a TrueBlue account, please do not sign into their account. If you do, the system will try to access their Travel Bank account instead of yours.

- You can book without both accounts being linked. To do this, stay out of your TrueBlue account and sign in to your Travel Bank account only. 

**What if I booked through a third party and can’t find my travel credit?**
- If you booked through a third party, you’ll need to contact them directly to locate your travel credit.
- They’ll need your ticket number to locate it, so be sure to have that ready when you contact them.
- If you’d like assistance from JetBlue directly, there’s a $50 per person service fee for us to take over your ticket from a third party.

### Credit expirations and open tickets

**My travel credit has an expiration date. Do I need to travel by that date?**
- No. Travel credits must be applied toward a new or existing booking by the expiration date, but you do not need to complete travel by that time.  
- For new reservations, use our Best Fare Finder tool to see our full schedule of flights up to 331 days out from the current date. 
- Credits are valid until 11:59pm Central Time on the date of expiration. Log in to your Travel Bank account and view the statement page to see each credit's expiration date.
- When using a travel credit, credits with the closest expiration date will be deducted first from your account.
- If you cancel a flight that was originally purchased using a JetBlue travel credit, the travel credit keeps its original expiration date when it is returned to your Travel Bank account. If a credit has already expired when the ticket is cancelled, it is not redeposited into your Travel Bank account.

**How long do I have to use my travel credit?**
- Since travel credit expiration dates may differ, it's always best to log in to your Travel Bank account and view the statement page to see each credit's exact expiration date. 

**Can travel credit expiration dates be extended?**
- Travel credits/expiration dates cannot be extended. 
- Flights need to be booked by the expiration date, or applied to an existing reservation by the expiration date.
- Travel can be completed later, and travel credits can be used by any travelers

**I have an open ticket. Does this work the same way as a travel credit?**
- No. An open ticket and Travel Bank funds are both forms of travel credit, but cannot be applied the same way: 
- Open tickets are valid for one year from the ticket’s original date of issue. 
- Booking is not available online. Please contact your original booking source to use the open ticket.
- Have the ticket number ready when rebooking your open tickets
- The open ticket’s value, applicable fees, and any difference in airfare are assessed when you rebook. 

### How to use JetBlue Vacations Credits
If you’ve received a JetBlue Vacations credit, it’s important to know how it’s different than a JetBlue travel credit. While both can be used to book your next JetBlue adventure, here are the key differences:

**A JetBlue Vacations credit...**
- Can be applied toward any portion of a JetBlue Vacations package.
- Can't be viewed or managed in your Travel Bank account.
- Can’t be applied online—it must be redeemed by calling JetBlue Vacations at 1-844-JB-VACAY (1-844-528-2229). Provide them with your confirmation code and the last four digits of the credit card used on the original JetBlue Vacations reservation. 

**A JetBlue travel credit...**
- Can be applied toward any flights for sale on jetblue.com or the flight portion of a JetBlue Vacations package.
- Can be viewed or managed in your Travel Bank account.
- Can be applied online by choosing Travel Bank on the Payment screen.

## Additional Info on How Some Perks Work

Some Perks You Pick and Mosaic Signature Perks have specific details.

### How Early Boarding works
TrueBlue members who select the Early Boarding perk can board with Group B on all JetBlue-operated flights (except when traveling on a Blue Basic fare) while the perk is valid. This perk extends to all eligible travel companions on the same reservation.

### How EvenMore® works (for Mosaics)
* **Mosaic 1:** Can select EvenMore® seats for free beginning at check-in (24 hours before departure) via online check-in, the app, or airport kiosk (pending availability). Excludes Blue Basic fares.
* **Mosaic 2 and above:** Can select EvenMore® seats for free during booking (pending availability) when choosing a Blue, Blue Plus, or Blue Extra fare (excludes Blue Basic).

### How Same-Day Switches works (for Mosaics)
All Mosaic members may make same-day switches starting 24 hours prior to scheduled departure, with no change fee and no fare difference. Excludes Blue Basic fares starting March 1, 2025. The same-day switch extends to all eligible travel companions on the same reservation.

### How JetBlue Vacations Bonus works
TrueBlue members who select the JetBlue Vacations bonus will automatically receive 2X base points on their individual portion of the *next* JetBlue Vacations package they fly. This perk cannot be earned on bonus points or on packages purchased with points. Travel must be booked and completed by the perk expiration date to receive the bonus points.

### How Mint Suite® Priority works
This perk gives a Mosaic member priority access to select from a reserved allocation of Mint suites on A321 Classic with Mint aircraft. Mosaics with this perk have exclusive access to select these reserved suites (if available) until 14 days before departure.
*Please note:* This is **not a Mint upgrade**. You must book a Mint seat to use this perk. This perk only applies to the benefit holder and does not extend to others on the same ticket.

### How FoundersCard Blue works
Mosaic members selecting this perk will receive a confirmation email with a link to enroll directly with FoundersCard. After activating, members receive a FoundersCard Blue Membership, granting 12 months of over 150 lifestyle, business, and travel benefits/discounts.
*Important:* If you do not cancel your subscription after 12 months, you’ll be charged their $395 annual fee. Mosaics who activated a FoundersCard Membership in 2022 can activate a Blue Membership if the previous one ended. Mosaics can reselect FoundersCard upon reaching an eligible tile milestone in 2024. FoundersCard Blue is valid for new FoundersCard members only and not valid for those affiliated with the travel industry.

### How $99 Statement Credit works
Mosaic members with a JetBlue Plus or Business card who select this perk will receive a $99 statement credit on their next JetBlue Card statement. It typically takes 2-4 weeks to appear and does not count toward the minimum monthly required payment.

### How the 20-Tile Bonus Perks work (Self & Gift)
When members select the 20-Tile Bonus (or Gift a 20-Tile Bonus) in a given year, the tiles are applied to the tile tracker for that same calendar year.
A member can choose to wait to select their 20-Tile Bonus until the *next* calendar year (if their perk expiration date allows), and the 20 tiles will apply to that *next* year's tracker.
The 20-Tile Bonus applies to only one calendar year. Tiles reset to 0 on January 1st each year.
*Example:* If you earn Mosaic 1 on Jan 4, 2024, you have until Dec 31, 2025 to pick the perk. You can select the 20-Tile Bonus anytime in 2024 to apply it to 2024, OR wait until Jan 2025 (e.g., Jan 31, 2025) to select it and apply it to your 2025 tracker. Selecting it in 2024 does not grant tiles again in 2025.

### How IHG Platinum Elite Status works
Mosaic members selecting this perk must provide their name and IHG One Rewards number during perk selection. IHG will then award Platinum Elite status through the end of the calendar year *following* the year in which the associated Mosaic level was earned. (E.g., Earn Mosaic 1 in 2024, select perk in 2024, status valid through Dec 31, 2025).

## Perks Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### How long are Perks You Pick valid?
Once selected, any Perks You Pick are valid from the date they were earned through the end (12/31) of the following year. The date you select them does not have any impact on their expiration date. We encourage you to select Perks You Pick as soon as you earn them, but they can be selected at any time between when they are earned and 12/31 of the following year. 

At the start of each new program year (1/1), the tile tracker on your dashboard will reset to 0 tiles, but any Perks You Pick that were earned and selected in the prior year are still valid through 12/31, unless it was a one-time perk that was already used. Points selected never expire. Tiles apply (and will be added to tile balance) immediately after selection for the year in which they were selected. Tile balances reset to 0 on January 1 of each year. Perks You Pick cannot be changed for any reason.  

### Can I change my perks?
Each time you reach a new tile milestone in the new year, you’ll have the chance to either: 
* keep the current perk (which extends it through the end of the following year) 
* swap it for a different perk (which will be valid through the end of the following year). 

If you choose to replace the current perk, it will expire the day you select the new one. 
Please note that Perks You Pick must be extended or replaced in order of their initial selection. 

**Note: Picked the 20-Tile Bonus in 2023 & want to keep it?**
Please note due to last year’s perk enhancements:
* If you want to pick it again (for yourself), swap it for the 20-Tile Bonus.
* If you want to gift it, swap it for Gift a 20-Tile Bonus.
